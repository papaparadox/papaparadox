## Featured Projects  
- [Back-End News Webpage](https://github.com/papaparadox/Seeding-NCNews)  
  Seeding NC News is a RESTful API that provides access to a database of articles, users, topics, and comments. It allows users to interact with the data by retrieving articles, posting comments, voting on articles, and more.
This project serves as the backend for a news website and follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.  

- [StackDew Valley](https://github.com/sophtompa/stackdew-valley)  
  Stackdew Valley is a web-browser game inspired by mentors from Northcoders and a farming simulator *Stardew Valley*.
The gameplay features custom dialogue triggers, physics-based movement, and interactive maps created with Phaser and Tiled. To support player progress, a back-end server was built using Firebase that enables user registration and basic item storage.
